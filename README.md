## 🏗️ Technical Stack

- **React 19** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking
- **Webpack 5** - Module bundler and dev server

- **CSS (native)** - Styling (no frameworks)

## 🏗️ Project Folder Scaffold

```
src/
├─ app/       # Minimal React shell (App.tsx, future router/providers)
├─ core/      # Domain-level interfaces and abstractions (ports)
├─ shared/    # Reusable implementations and UI components (adapters)
├─ features/  # Business modules following hexagonal layers

```

- `app/` mounts the application and wires global providers.
- `core/` defines contracts that domain/application code depend on.
- `shared/` holds infrastructure adapters and shared presentation building blocks.
- `features/` encapsulates each feature with domain/application/infrastructure/presentation slices.
- `styles/` centralises global styling applied at bootstrap.
